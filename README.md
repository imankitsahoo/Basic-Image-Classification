TensorFlow : Basic Image Classification


This project guides you through building and training a Neural Network model to classify handwritten digits using TensorFlow and Keras. By the end, you'll gain a foundational understanding of:

Image Classification: How to categorize images into predefined classes based on their content.
Neural Networks: The core concept behind neural networks and their application in machine learning.
TensorFlow with Keras: Leveraging TensorFlow's capabilities with the user-friendly Keras API for building and training models.
